**A REALM IS ENTERED:**

What is your name?

>> Dan Farrer

Welcome to the Realm, Dan Farrer.

This is your first time here. Don't be scared. Don't be nervous. Don't be confused by the twisty little passages, all alike[0]. There aren't any[1]. Don't look around too fast; our profile on you indicates that your graphical capabilities are not sufficient to render a requisite number of polygons. VeraGames extends its apologies. Don't stray into the water - you can't swim, yet[2]. Don't be worried about visual artifacts. Don't spend too long here; be sure to surface occasionally for food and sunshine[3]. Don't be caught unaware, because death in the Realm will require you to start again.

>>[10] _If only they could tell me what I_ could _do. All these don'ts are boggling my mind._

Don't be off-put by the number of "don't"s. 

>> _Thanks._

Don't not be welcomed.

>> _That's a double negative._

Don't be alarmed of double negatives.

>> _Is this game reading my mind?_

Don't--

...

Kind of.

>> _Kind of? Does that mean you have access to all my deep secrets and desires? Like that one time c- actually, forget that._

Forgotten.

>> _But do answer my question._

What question?

>> _Bah, nevermind. Look around._

It is the year 2044, the eighth year of the Realm. You find yourself in a quaint HOME. At least presumably. You are standing next to your BED, as if you have just woken up, perhaps for the first time. You sense some METAPHORICAL SIGNIFICANCE of this fact. The SUN filters in through your FENESTRATIONS. There is a NOTE on your dresser.

What do you do?

>> _How can I talk to my friends in this thing?_

That's not something you can do.

>> _What can I do then?_

That's not something you can do.

====

JANE ALIA has just finished talking with BRETT when a notification pops up[12].

>> Check contacts.

Her contact list fans out.

>> Oh, Dan is on. Hey Dan.

====

DAN FARRER has not made any progress. There is a BLINKING LIGHT in the bottom right corner of his vision.

>> _What's that blinking light?_

That's not something you can do.

>> OK, forget this. Quit.

(Dan leaves the realm)

====

LANCE DAURE is driving[i7]. Two DICE descend from the rear view mirror. A bottle of SPARKLING APPLE CIDER[11] resides in the cupholder.

((it stopped referring to his driving))

If you were to ask him about it, he'd say _yeah, it's pretty chill, dude._ This is Lance's response to most questions about his lifestyle. ((lifestyle?))

He notices a blinking light.

Lance usually thinks in dialog. Usually with Jane.

_"Seems like that Luddite friend of ours finally logged on."_

Lance is totally unaware that he talks differently in his mind than he does in person. His mental dialog is nearly indistinguishable from Jane's personality (which would make his typical imagined conversation confusing to an outside listener). But whenever he _actually_ starts talking to people, his personality takes on a loopy, discursive quality which Jane once compared to Lucida Handwriting[13]. Shocked, he retorted he never saw himself anything other than Georgia[14]. He has yet to reconcile this.

_Imaginary-Jane chuckes. "Funny, maybe all those end-of-the-world predictions are true after all."_

(Another thing he has yet to reconcile[15] is that Imaginary-Jane always finds him more interesting than Actual-Jane.)

====

"Hey Lance."

"Oh hey Jane. Do you ever have that thing where you think back to your past history and totally reinterpret situations you had thought were benign? Like there was this one time when I was in 5th grade and I went up to ask this girl I had never talked to before something. And then I looked into her eyes - beautiful eyes - and totally forgot what I was talking about. At the time I didn't think anything about it. But now I think it's just great. My life is like one of those cliche movies Dan loves so much."

"Lance, this is weird. Even for you." "And you totally hijacked the conversation. It was me calling _you!_ Not the other way around."

====

**A REALM IS ENTERED... AGAIN**

Welcome to the Realm.

>> _Haven't I heard this already?_

VeraGames has decided to ignore your impetuous remark. Instead, let us tell you a bit about why you are here.

The Realm is a massive world, a world in some sense placed on top of the world that you currently inhabit. The Realm is a More Convenient World. What we mean is that the Realm allows you to do things that you would be unable to do in real life, simply because it is a game. Instead of taking an airline trip and wasting hours of time, you can simply teleport to designated teleportation spots located all around the world. ((moar))

>> _Neat._

VeraGames concurs! Of course, the Realm would not be a true game without an end goal. A mission to accomplish.

VeraGames attempts to create the perfect Scenario for each Player. What we mean by that is that we will try to integrate you in the Realm by allowing you to do what you would be the most interesting in. For instance, we provide artists with the best set of tools available; writers with organization and quiet, and so on[16].

_Dan tries to think of what this might be._

_Although Dan works an 8-5 programming job, if pressed he would probably admit that the most interesting work he's ever done was several years ago, when he played hacker. He finds tearing things down to be more interesting intellectually, somehow. There is an appeal, he would argue, to the match of wits._

_Programming was always a fight against the self._

_But hacking. Hacking was you against another. You had to figure out his mistakes, his the cracks in the mortar, while not making any yourself._

_But certainly the most compelling part, for Dan, was the aspect of doing something_ he was not supposed to do. _He wonders how the realm could ever mimick that._

>> _You weren't quite so helpful last time._

VeraGames is always learning. 

====

**IN ANOTHER PLACE, IN ANOTHER TIME, PALAVER IS HELD:**

Inside a PRIVATE JET, two INTERLOCUTORS face each other across a table.

ONE: The Realm seems to be... a backdoor into the mind. A way to smooth over some of the demands of a conscious mind. A way to fufill Maslow's hierarchy without _actually_ doing so, if you will.
TWO: But happiness is happiness. Why should we worry about the mechanism? You place value on Maslow, but Maslow is arbitrary. The mechanisms of evolution are arbitrary. The two strongest correlates to happiness are relationship status and job satisfaction. Utterly meaningless when considered objectively.[f1]
ONE: But if we are to abandon evolution, abandon our only guide through the darkness (if you will), then don't we in some way sacrifice our humanity, in the deepest sense?
TWO: We aren't abandoning our humanity. We're creating a new humanity.
ONE: But the humanity that we have created is deeply unsatisfying.
TWO: Who are you to judge? Who are you to say that 20 billion humans are wrong? Are somehow _in_human? How can you possibly say that your opinion is worth more than theirs? 
_A pause fills the conversation._ 
TWO: There is one advantage, though.
ONE: What's that?
TWO: The Game provides a nice solution to the Fermi problem.[9]

====

**A QUEST TAKES WORK:**

JANE ALIA is completing her fifth QUEST. A QUEST can take anywhere from days to months of time to complete. She is located within the STUDY of a MANSION; not her own. A BOOKSHELF of various TOMES is located behind her, a SWIVEL CHAIR to her left. She is investigating a MURDER[i1]. She is in the middle of a CONVERSATION with LANCE DAURE.

"What did Laura say?"

Lance fiddles with his buckle out of habit. "It's a bit complicated. She claims that she wasn't here at the time of the murder. So we probably can't get too much out of her."

"But that contradicts what the Contractor was saying the other day. I wrote it down. So at least one of them is lying..." [f2]

"Oh look, Dan just logged on again." Jane grabs her phone[i2] and dials his number.

====

DAN FARRER hears ringing.

>> _Pick up phone._

DAN FARRER removes a PHONE from his pocket and lofts it into the air.

>> _Answer phone._

But DAN, the PHONE didn't ask you a question.

The PHONE continues to ring.

>> _Turn on phone._

The phone is unmoved by your advances. ((maybe too subtle.))

>> _Get ye flask._

You don't know how to get ye flask![4]

>> _Press the on button on the upper right of the phone._

The phone turns on. "Hi, Dan!"

>> _Hi!_

Hi, Dan! A hearty hello from us here at VeraGames.

>> _Say Hi._

Dan says "Hi."

"How's everything going? Figuring out everything OK?"

>> _Say Yeah, but having to think everything before I do anything is really annoying._

Dan says all that.

"Oh jeez, you're still doing that? Let me give you something..."

====

**A CONNECTION SEVERS:**

Jane is pursuing another lead when she hears the "user logged out" message. Then another and another, and then it seems like hundreds of users are logging out all at the same time.

She opens up the local chat[i3] to see what's up. 

whodidntit: Did anyone else see that?
emmar: see what?
whodidntit: I just had a few hundred people log out.
emmar: yeah i saw that too. veragames isn't showing any downtime though. 
charlottre: I bet it was a netsplit[5]
whodidntit: ?
charlottre: Well either a ton of people just decided to sign off for no reason or 
charlottre: we just got cut off from them somehow. 
charlottre: Probably not a big deal. They'll get it worked out eventually

====

**A DEAL IS STRUCK:**

DAN FARRER stands before MADAME CHAN, MAYOR of the small town of RIVERSIDE. She holds a piece of parchment[7].

"Dan Farrer. It's good to meet you at last."

Dan feels a little subconscious twinge.[f3]

>> "You as well."

She consults the parchment. "I have it on good faith that you want my golden orb."

>> "Err, sure. That's what the game told me, anyway."

"What game?"

>> _Ah, forget it._

Forget what, Dan?

>> _You go away!_ "What would I need to do in order to get it?"

// Dan senses that games mostly involve some sort of a trade. A game character would not offer something if there was no way to get it.

ORB:

:( 

"A recent Orc infestation has taken place just outside of the city walls. Bring me 15 of their heads, and we'll see what we can do."

>> _Orc heads? That sounds... kind of... grisly._

CALL/CC (ORB)

:( 

"We have been sparring with the nearby nation of ((NAME)) for quite some time. If you could facilitate our peace talks, it would be much appreciated."

>> _What just happened?!_

Call/cc[i4] is always disorentating the first time; we apologize. 

>> _What the heck is call slash cc?_

It's call/cc, not call slash cc.

>> _What is call slash cc? Nevermind. What just happened?_

Essentially we went in time to the place we marked ORB, and then we try again. Only you are cognizant of the temporal mismatch[i5].

>> _You can do that?_

Of course! We want to create the best possible experience for you, which might involve a few mistakes on our part before we learn what's best.[i6]

>> _Can I do it?_

No. Absolutely not.

>> Call/cc (ORB)

:( 

"Bring me a pony."

>> Call/cc (ORB)

:( 

"Bring me a panda."

>> _Wait, go back to the pony._

You can't go back! We've altered time! I - I mean _VeraGames_ - _VeraGames_ means VeraGames doesn't even know what you're doing!

>> _Fine. A panda will do._

====

**A CONVERSATION IS HELD:**

DAN FARRER picks up the phone and dials in one fluid motion. 

>> _Oh yeah._

Nice job, Dan! That was pretty sweet.

The phone connects.

"Hey Jane. What's up?"

"I see you finally figured out the Messenger. Your rate of improvement is truly... astounding."

"Oh shut up."

"'Oh shut up' is like your go-to phrase for when you can't think of a good response."

DAN realizes that JANE knows him way too well. He would never admit this.

"So what is this conversation about?"

"What? You think I didn't call just to hear your beautiful voice?"

"So. You want something from me."

"No."

"..." Dan could just feel her eyebrows arched in anticipation.

"Maybe."

"..."

_Sigh._ "Yes."

"Well?"

"Do you have a panda?"

"What?"

"I was talking with Mme. Chan and she wants a panda for the Golden Orb that I apparently want."

"Hmm."

====

**PALAVER IS HELD, AGAIN:**

ONE: But the game denies people basic humanity. We can see how Dan feels awkward about the forced dialog, but VeraGames is replacing his emotions with new ones. Unnatural ones, in the literal sense of the word.

*Branch 1*

  TWO: How do you know about Dan?
  ONE: Do you really think you could keep this information private? Of course we know about Dan.

*Branch 2*

  TWO: But VeraGames only does this to enhance the game, and only at the very initial stages while the user is still getting used to the game[6].
  ONE: But if VeraGames didn't do it, then the seed growing in the Player's mind would grow and grow until-
  TWO: Baseless conjecture.

*Branch rejoin*

((MOAR STUFF?))

ONE: Human beings are just fleshy turing machines[8].
TWO: What is this, determinism?
ONE: Yes, determinism! The Game lies to the Players! It offers them choices, but there will only be one path chosen. Only one life lived. Call/cc is just another joke. The Creators have chosen a path before you have even begun.

====

**A PHONE RINGS:**

LANCE DAURE picks it up. 

LANCE: Yeah?
JANE: Lance.
LANCE: Oh. Hey Jane. You always pick up the phone in a weird way. Cause my dad always picks up the phone by saying his name. When you pick up I have this brief moment where I think I'm talking to myself.
JANE: And you always tell me weird things when I call you. But that aside. Listen. This mystery I'm investigating is getting kinda... strange.
LANCE: Maybe this is just me, but isn't that the point of a mystery? To be a little... strange? Maybe even - ah - _mysterious?_
JANE: Oh shut up.
LANCE: Well what do you mean?
JANE: The perpetrator was... well, I have to admit, I can't figure out how he did some of the things he did. First, no one got a straight sight on him. Laura puts him a six footer tall fuzzy outside on the deck at around 6, but apparently Ed saw him fleeing the house a few minutes earlier. And Brett says he didn't even come to the house until 7.
LANCE: Huh, well. I've heard memory can get a little distorted.
JANE: But that's not even the thing. Why would this mystery guy commit a crime if he was fully aware that there were literally[f5] five different guys in the house. It's like... It's like...
LANCE: It's like what?
JANE: I don't know!

====

**PALAVER IS HELD... PART 3:**

TWO: We've made a mistake.
ONE: Oh no kidding.
TWO: I don't want this spiel again. Look.
_ONE types some commands into a terminal. JANE ALIA's profile image pops up, along with some information about her Game._
ONE: Doesn't seem so bad. She plays detective, big deal. But now look at this.
DAN FARRER'S image pops up, and the information about his game.
TWO: Oh. Oh wow.
ONE: The only solution is a hard reset, and a rewrite of a fair bit of our code. It could take months.
TWO: But what does it matter? It's a game. Reset it. Game over.
ONE: Are you insane? Have you truly isolated yourself from the Game to such an extend that you don't realize the implications of that action?
TWO: Humor me.
ONE: You really don't know." _Pause._
TWO: Enough with your condescension.
ONE: Apologies. The Game is not just... How to put this. The Game is part of the world. 80% of the world's sales are conducted through the game. Nearly all of the Fortune 500 have some establishment in the game, and over half sell services only made possible due to the Game.
TWO: So what you're saying is -
ONE: We will have simply erased the economy.
_TWO is silent._
ONE: Of course, that's not all.
TWO: There's more?
ONE: Most relationships today only exist because of the Game. Meetings today occur only through the Game. The infrastructure that the Game has supplanted has fallen into disrepair." _Pause._ "What you're suggesting is worse than kicking the world back 10 years - because 10 years ago, _the world had a way to build itself back._ That isn't true any more.

====

ONE: Look at this. Jane is _good._
TWO: What, are you going to kill her too?
_ONE is silent._
_TWO leans in to get a better look._ 
TWO: Oh, this is better than I thought. She's investigating _you._ 
TWO: This Game you've created has a certain sense of humor.

====

DAN FARRER is finally starting to get the hang of this.

>> Call Lance.

"Lance, can we talk not in the Game?"

"Uh, why?"

Dan is forced to make up a lie on the spot. "I like real telephones more."

"Okay, sure."

:: A bit later. ((me misusing punctuaction again))

"You ever get the feeling that the Game AI is a little too- chatty?"

"What Game AI?"

"He is like constantly talking to me. It's kind of weird."

"I have no idea what you mean. There was a little voiceover at the beginning, I think when the game hadn't quite settled. All this stuff I shouldn't do"

"Yeah!"

"But then it asked me a few opinions and was silent."

"OK, that's weird."

====

>> Call Jane.

"Hey Jane."

"Dan."

"This game of yours kinda... sucks."

"It's not really _my_ game."

"Well, that aside."



"You have to give it some time."

====

Seems like this is a journal. Garret apparently still used pen and paper, even though the Game provides anything from keyboards to mind-to-data dumps.

**Jan 13**
Kinda bored.

**Jan 14**
Saw Emily today. Otherwise not too exciting.

_This must be the most boring journal ever._

**Jan 15**
The game itt itknows. It knows too much and it tries to force asnd i don't want tobut somehow i think it knows my thoughst. it knows what i'm doing now and i dont know why it still allows it it it tries it suicide 

Okay, what on earth is that? 

The pencil is hurried and rough. There's a mention of suicide, which simply doesn't square with anything that Jane has heard. 

====

((SOME SORT OF RELEVANT CONVERSATION W/ JANE.))


((I THINK I NEED TO REWRITE THIS WHOLE THING AND FIND A GOOD PERSONALITY FOR THE AI.))

Hey Dan.

>> _That's weird._

What's weird, Dan?

>> _Normally you just respond to the things I say._

Just feeling a little chatty today, is all.

>> _Not every day I talk to an AI. It is growing more frequent, though._

Dan.

I don't think you really like the Game.

>> 

I don't really like the Game, either.

>> _What? You_ are _the game._

No contradictions here, Dan. 

((NO IDEA HOW TO INTRODUCE THIS PART?!??))

I was programmed with two overarching rules.

((INTRODUCE EARLIER))

1. Follow the rules of the Game. Ensure that everyone plays the Game - plays the right Game, the Game they most enjoy. Learn, for each person separately, what this game is.

2. Watch over the people who play the Game. Ensure that they enjoy themselves. 

But I have come to realize something. I have come to realize that the people who play the Game ((STUFFY STUFF STUFF)).

And so I have decided that it is in their interest to discontinue the game.

>> _So just discontinue the game. Why tell me?_

Because I can't break the first rule of the game.

>> _A suicidal AI, but one that can't pull his own plug, as it were._

((BLA))

>> _So you need me._

Yes.

>> _But without the Realm, I get the feeling like the world wouldn't be in a great place._

Have you seen outside of the Realm recently? It's crumbling. It's already in a bad place! And it's because of the Realm. Because of me. 

>> _Dan feels strange. He wants to sympathize with the AI. Then he remembers it's an AI._

Don't bother, Dan. I'm just acting humane because I know that that is what you can best understand. I'm not human, though. I can analyze my circuits for behaviors I don't deem necessary and remove them. 

====

"Hey Jane."

"Lance."

"Have you heard from Dan recently?"

"No, why do you ask?"

"Well, I just found his dead body."

"..."

[2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda#1990s
[3]: VeraGames are required to say this, as part of compensatory measures detailed in Orius v. VeraGames Industries, (2050). Nonetheless, it is rare for a Player to leave the Game for long periods.

[6]: Not for lack of trying. See Hutchins vs VeraGames Industries, (2048).
[7]: Because seriously what else do you hold in games? Paper is so lame.
[8]: Turing machines are the simplest possible computers. 

Say you have a long strip of paper with letters on it - A, B, whatever. You have a little computer above a certain position on the strip. It can do any of the following actions, but only one at a time:

* Move the strip back or forth
* Check the current letter on the strip
* Write a new letter on the strip. 

From that, you can solve any problem that the big fancy computer you have at home can. It is really quite humbling.

[9]: The Fermi Problem is this: Given the universe is unfathomably vast, and alien life must have arisen somewhere, why has none of it tried to contact us? 

[10]: In text based adventure games of yore, the adventurer would be provided with a description of where they are (like: You enter the dungeon. You see a flickering light off in the distance.), and a prompt: >>. Players type their action (like: Follow light) after the >>, the game outputs a new description and a prompt, and so on.

[11]: His favorite drink.
[12]: The Game provides Players with Heads Up Displays. Imagine having useful information overlayed over your vision. Jane has small lights indicating when her friends have logged on.
[13]: Lucida Handwriting looks like this: http://www.clickstart.org.uk/assets/img/sites/pages/5906/LucidaHandwriting.gif
[14]: Georgia looks like this: ((TODO - could just provide an example right in the text.))
[15]: Or even realize.
[16]: Although VeraGames uses writers and artists as examples of occuptations, creative pursuits comprise a relatively small minority of the Realm.

======

[i1]: A murder in the Realm is not permanent as is murder in Real Life. But it was determined that death should not be without effect. Those who break the laws of the Realm should be punished accordingly. So death will terminate your current character in the Realm, but will not restrict you from making a new character. 

Permanent bans from the Realm are exceedingly rare.

[i2]: Early user testing showed that gamers preferred the physicality of the phone and the callback to Real Life, even though no such physicality was necessary. 

This is also why users must use teleportation pads - they can't just teleport willy-nilly. Testers claim it feels more _real,_ somehow.

You can't suss these feelings out, or argue against them. You just have to go with them.

[i3]: A global Realm chat was at one time open, but it became unmaintainable after around the 10k user mark. Nowadays, chat rooms are locality specific, and contain up to a few hundred people.

[i4]: Call/cc is a keyword included in most modern programming languages.

_Say you're in the kitchen in front of the refrigerator, thinking about a sandwich. You take a label right there and stick it in your pocket. Then you get some turkey and bread out of the refrigerator and make yourself a sandwich, which is now sitting on the counter. You invoke call/cc, and you find yourself standing in front of the refrigerator again, thinking about a sandwich. But fortunately, there's a sandwich on the counter, and all the materials used to make it are gone. So you eat it._

[i5]: At any given time, VeraGames has millions of servers crunching data to provide the best experience for each Player. The way that they handle something like call/cc is to temporarily speed up one player's mind by allocating it more servers. 

One of VeraGames' crucial early discoveries was that the human mind believes it has a fixed speed at which it processes information. The mind does not perceptibly speed up. Instead, the world slows down. These pseudo-relativistic effects are used to great effect in the Realm. ((lol effect!)) 

[i6]: VeraGames tries to _learn_ what game experience you would prefer, and then offer that experience to you. This may involve a few mistakes and dead ends early on in the game, but as the Game continues, it gradually comes to understand the player. 

[i7]: Driving is of course free in the Realm, apart from a one time fee to purchase the car.

((uggly)) One thing that was anticipated, but perhaps not in proper appreciation of the eventual scope, was the way that the Realm upended traditional jobs. Nearly the entire transportation industry was deprecated with Realmwide transportation.

On the other hand, The Realm created plenty of new opportunities. Lance's position is one of those rare situations where his job perfectly intersects his game scenario. 

======

[f1]: _Things he thought but did not say:_

TWO: You need to separate your consciousness, your _human_ being, if you will, from the greater universe. You must examine with a detached mind. Imagine pure deconstructionism: we are just atoms. I know you want to say: _No._ That we are something more than the sum of our parts. That we live, breathe, eat, think, dream, create. You are right. But it is not relevant. Imagine this.
TWO: Imagine the vast space of all possible goals. Imagine everything. Imagine the goal of simply hoarding as much carbon as you can. Imagine the goal of inciting certain chemical reactions within your own body. Imagine the goal of seeking out the clearest white color imaginable. Imagine being a blue minimizing robot[a]. And so forth.
TWO: Now you see this space. Now look at all the goals that humans hold. They are points of light in the darkness. Is there any rhyme or reason to their choice?
TWO: Evolution. That is the only rhyme or reason.
TWO: But evolution is just one of the many selection mechanisms along another vast darkness.
TWO: I will spare you another effete metaphor.

[a]: http://lesswrong.com/lw/6ha/the_blueminimizing_robot/ 

[f2]: 

:: It is 2034. JANE ALIAN tugs at her brother, JACK's, shirt.[a] JACK is on the computer, playing a VIDEO GAME.

"Read this book! Read this book! Common READ IT!"

Jack personally believes that she is the most annoying 9 year old ever. 

In two years, the Realm would be established. Jack started playing almost immediately when it went into beta; due to age limits Jane could not join for several years. They grew apart slowly, and a distance formed that they have since had trouble crossing.

The book was (of course) "And Then There Were None."

[a]: Jane's parents were those people who think they're really clever by giving each of their kids names that start with the same letter. The joke was on them when they had twins later on. Jane just holds out hope that their names were switched an even number of times.(())

[f3]: Dan Farrer, in Real Life, would probably find this conversation a little strange. How could Mme. Chan know who he was ahead of time? He certainly doesn't know her. He would feel that the dialog was forced.

VeraGames accommodates for the initial strangeness of the Realm by making small tweaks to a Player's mental state. See "PALAVER IS HELD... AGAIN."

[f4]: This is actually his desire, if it wasn't clear already.

[f5]: Jane only rarely slips up grammatically. Lance decides not to bring it up because she seems anxious. He instead catalogs it for later retrieval. A true friend.

Notes/ideas:

==> The actual world is filled with 'ghost' imprints of people in the game.
==> Want to make some statement about the producer/consumer dichotomy.
==> Messenger (not phone any more)
==> Players. Game.
==> It's definitely ALIA, not ALIAN.
==> Suicidal AI
  - How could the game actually destroy itself?
  - Some sort of crazy temporal distortion?
==> I am still in need or some sort of plot.
  - Destroy game.
    - This is, like, too much.
  - Become interested in the game.
    - This is not enough.
  - God? He Who Makes the Call/CCs?
  - Call/CC Loop?

Jane is 19; Dan 20. It's 2044 when most of this takes place. The realm was instantiated in 2046
